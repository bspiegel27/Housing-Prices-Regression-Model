# Housing Prices Regression Model
General Assembly Data Science Immersive Project - Multiple Linear Regression Housing Price Cohort Competition
# Overview
This project includes the first model I built as part of the General Assembly Data Science Immersive program. The project was a competition to predict prices in Ames, IA housing data and is based on a prior [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). This competition included ~100 total immersive students whose goal was to achieve the lowest possible root-mean-squared-error (RMSE), and was conducted across weeks 2 and 3 of the 12-week program. This project demonstrates my ability and passion for conducting thorough EDA, feature engineering, and feature selection ahead of model building. As a result, I was able to ensure low variance on testing data used to score models, and placed 7th in lowest RMSE. 

Note: At this point in the curriculum, we covered all of the basics of python programming and were introduced to the linear regression model in sk-learn. As such, more advanced modeling techniques (PCA, hyper-parameter tuning, spline interpolation, bagging/boosting, gradient descent) and types (decision trees, support vector machines, etc) were not included, though would definitely improve model performance
