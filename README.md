# Housing-Prices-Regression-Model
General Assembly Data Science Immersive Project - Multiple Linear Regression Housing Price Cohort Competition
# Project Overview
This project includes the first model I built as part of the General Assembly Data Science Immersive program. The project was a competition to predict prices in Ames, IA housing data and is based on a prior kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). This competition included ~100 total immersive students whose goal was to achieve the lowest possible root-mean-squared-error (RMSE), and was conducted across weeks 2 and 3 of the 12-week program. As you will see in the notebooks within this repository, this project demonstrates my ability to conduct thorough EDA and carefully select features to optimize model performance, and achieve low variance. At that point in time, we covered all of the basics of python programming, as well as
